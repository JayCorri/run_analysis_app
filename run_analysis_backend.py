Run Analysis Backend Functions
Version: 3.1

Description:
This module contains the backend functions for the Run Analysis App, including database interactions,
user authentication, data logging, and regimen-specific schedule management.

New Features in v3.1:
- **Regimen Management**: Retrieves and manages schedules for multiple regimens (e.g., NSW Candidate, Marathon).
- **User Settings Persistence**: Saves and loads user settings for regimen and week, ensuring data consistency across sessions.
- **Goal Tracking**: Defines weekly goals for endurance, stamina, and speed, and updates based on user input.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced database error reporting and user feedback for seamless experience.

Future Plans:
- Expand support for more complex regimens and training programs.
- Optimize database queries for enhanced performance with larger datasets.
